# Numerical Methods Project 2
#### Contributor: Dumitrascu Filip Teodor

## Task 1
  Apply compression to an image using reduced decomposition of singular values.

## Task 2
  Algorithm calculates principal components using SVD method.

## Task 3
  Calculate the principal components using the covariance matrix.

## Task 4
  With the help of eigenvalues and eigenvectors the problem is solved of digit recognition

## Documentation used
  To perform the tasks I used the function documentation provided by both the 'help function' in the command window and the octave website https://docs.octave.org. From there I took information like:

- all uses of reshape
- use of eig
- descend option of sort
- use of svd
- use of median    (In addition to what I already knew)
